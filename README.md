# daymet-spet-visualize

This application is a tool to visualize data from the [Daymet Daily Surface Weather](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1840) via the [Daymet Single Pixel Extraction Tool](https://daymet.ornl.gov/single-pixel/).  The primary use case is to show the historical range of temperature (minimum and maximum) and precipitation for a particular range of days in a year for a particular location.  The motivating use case is

> As a person interested in visiting a location (in North America) at a particular time of year, I want to know the range of conditions at that location at that ime of year over the past few decades so that I know how to prepare for my visit.

The code was initially developed for a University of Tennessee undergraduate student practicum experience in scientific data visualization.
